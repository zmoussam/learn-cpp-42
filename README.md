# C++ Exercises and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

Welcome to the C++ (42-Network) Exercises and Object-Oriented Programming Concepts repository! This repository is designed to help learners practice their C++ programming skills from the ground up, covering the fundamentals and progressing through various Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

Each directory within this repository corresponds to a specific topic, ranging from `cpp_00` to `cpp_09`, and contains multiple exercises. The exercises are categorized and named as `ex00`, `ex01`, `ex02`, and so on. You'll find detailed instructions for each exercise within their respective directories.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `cpp_00`: Introduction to C++ Basics
  Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic
  stuff
  
- `cpp_01`: More C++ Basics
   Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement

- `cpp_02`: Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form

- `cpp_03`: Inheritance

- `cpp_04` : Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces

- `cpp_05` : Repetition and Exceptions

- `cpp_06` : C++ casts

- `cpp_07` : C++ templates

- `cpp_08` : Templated containers, iterators, algorithms

- `cpp_09` : STL


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
  git clone https://github.com/zmoussam/cpp_42 
2. Navigate to the specific topic directory that you want to work on:
  cd cpp_09

3. Choose an exercise you want to work on (e.g., `ex00`) and read the exercise instructions provided in the respective directory.

4. Write your solution for the exercise in a C++ source file.

5. Compile and run your solution using a C++ compiler

6. Compare your solution's output with the expected output mentioned in the exercise description.

7. Move on to the next exercise or topic as you progress through the repository.
